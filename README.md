# SlotMachine
In this project, we'll create a basic slot machine game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The slot machine will have three reels, and each reel will contain various symbols. The player can give input , and the reels will start spinning randomly. After a few seconds, the reels will stop, and if the symbols on the reels form a winning combination, the player wins!!
